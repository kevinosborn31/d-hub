        title: 'Blood Sugar Regulation',

        title: 'Types of Diabetes',
        content: 'Type 1 Diabetes: It is an autoimmune disease where the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. People with type 1 diabetes require lifelong insulin therapy.\n\nType 2 Diabetes: It primarily results from insulin resistance, where the body\'s cells don\'t respond effectively to insulin. Over time, the pancreas may also produce less insulin. Type 2 diabetes can often be managed with lifestyle changes, medications, and insulin if necessary.'
